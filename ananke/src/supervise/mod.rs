//! Service supervision: per-service tokio tasks, child lifetimes, health loops.
//!
//! Linux-coupled via `os::unix::process::ExitStatusExt` (signal() on ExitStatus)
//! and the submodules it delegates to (`drain`, `orphans`, `spawn`).
//!
//! [`handle`] is the client-facing entry point (the command/response types and
//! [`spawn_supervisor`]); this file holds the actor loop itself — [`RunLoop`],
//! its dispatcher [`run`], and the `Step`/`*Outcome` vocabulary shared across
//! every phase module ([`idle`], [`starting`], [`running`], [`dispatch`],
//! [`terminal`]) plus the supporting [`context`], [`reservation`],
//! [`eviction`], [`ensure`], [`watchdogs`], and [`auto_restart`] modules.
