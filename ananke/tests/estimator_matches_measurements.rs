//! Check the estimator against the measurement dataset.
//!
//! `calibration/data/measurements.ndjson` records what real
//! `llama-server` processes actually held, on real hardware, across every
//! model and flag combination the calibration campaign covered. These tests
//! replay it: each record's `parsed` block carries the model's shape, so a
//! synthetic summary can be built from it and the estimator run against the
//! same configuration the measurement was taken under. No GGUF is needed,
//! which is what lets this run in CI.
//!
//! Two tiers, because the evidence is not equally strong:
//!
//! - **Exact.** The pinned graph arena is compared against llama.cpp's own
//!   logged `CUDA_Host compute buffer size`. Same quantity, so the model
//!   either reproduces it or is wrong, and the tolerance is a rounding error.
//! - **Banded.** The process baseline is compared against `/proc`, which
//!   carries far more that the estimator does not model. The assertion is the
//!   one the constants actually claim: that every model lands inside the
//!   rolling correction's `[0.8, 1.5]`, because a prediction outside that band
//!   cannot be pulled back by any amount of observation.
//!
//! **Hardware.** Every row was taken on one machine, so this validates the
//! estimator against that machine and says nothing about any other. If rows
//! from different hardware are ever pooled, the derivations behind these
//! constants take a plain mean over whatever is in the file — they carry no
//! hardware term and would silently blend two populations. That is a known
//! and deliberate gap, recorded here rather than in a commit message, and it
//! has to be closed before contributed data can be merged.
